## Thank you for your support :)
If you have a BIP47 compatible wallet like [Samourai Wallet](https://samouraiwallet.com/download) or [Sparrow Wallet](https://www.sparrowwallet.com/), you can use a [PayNym](https://paynym.is/+icysun189) to send a donation (this QR code is different than a Bitcoin address):
